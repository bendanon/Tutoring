Please NEVER use RAR again

Part 2 - 
2. The reason for the slowdown is not the amount of memory in each iteration but amount of context switches from the user space in which your program runs and the kernel space in which the file is actually read from the disk). Every system call invokes this kind of context switch. (-8)
3.What extra system calls are made under the conditions of this question? (-4)

Part 3-
2. They don't create system calls. The answer is "False - Pressing a key on the keyboard may cause an interrupt, not a system call." (-2)
4.User mode applications have access to the memory they allocate. They don't have direct access to the disk (-1)
5.Not all of the applications that are incorporated in the kernel run in user mode (-1)
6.True - The operating system can disable all interrupts temporarily when it is running critical code in order to avoid delays by interrupts. (-3)
10.False - External devices access the operating system using Interrupts, not system calls.(-3)
